###Smart Bins###
This is an nnovative waste management solution that optimizes garbage collection routes using real-time data from IoT-enabled smart bins. This system incorporates bin fill levels, spoilage status, and traffic conditions to create efficient collection routes, improving urban sanitation and reducing operational costs.


## Repository Structure

This repository contains three main components of the SUTT system:

1. `/arduino` - Hardware Design Files
2. `/node-red` - Dashboard Design Files
3. `/android` - Mobile Application Files

## 1. Arduino Files (Hardware Design)

The `/arduino` directory contains the code and schematics for the IoT-enabled smart bin hardware. This includes:

- Sensor integration (fill level and spoilage detection)
- Microcontroller programming
- Communication module setup


## 2. Node-RED Files (Dashboard Design)

The `/node-red` directory includes the flow files for the SUTT dashboard. This dashboard visualizes:

- Real-time bin status
- Collection route optimization
- Historical data and analytics


## 3. Android App (SUTT Mobile Application)

The `/android` directory contains the source code for the SUTT mobile application. This app allows waste management teams to:

- View optimized collection routes
- Receive real-time updates
- Log collection activities


## System Requirements

- Arduino IDE [version:2.3.0]
- Node-RED [version: 3.1.5]
- Android Studio [version: 1.2.11]
